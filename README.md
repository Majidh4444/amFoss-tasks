# My view about the tasks/Task-01/
By overall I can say that some of the tasks are easy and some are moderate, remaining are bit harder for me. Because I dont have any background in coding feild so it took more time for me to solve each task. As the deadline is coming still I haven't completed some of the tasks, especially the flutter task was not completed because my laptop does not have enough specifications to run android studio which is used for simulaton purpose and if I buy my new laptop or if I update my present one I'll definitely complete this task. 

By finally I can say that these tasks has build a lot of knowledge which I supposed to learn. And, Iam really thankfull for amFoss club for providing these everything for us. 

# Introduction

Hi Seniors Iam Majidh from Kuppam,Chittor(Dist),AndraPradesh. I came to know about the amFoss club after joining the college by some of the seniors and by my friends. I have completed my inter 1st and 2nd year in hyderabad(Telangana). 

I thought by joining these club I can gain more knowledge in coding feild and by that I thought of exploring more.

I took more time For completing this tasks especially at night because at morning time there were classes runing and had a lab sections at afternoon. And I feel very happy everytime when I complete a particiular task beacause it had bbosted me alot to proceed with other tasks.
